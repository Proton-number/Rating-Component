## My process
 This was my first time working on react and yeah i was frustrated alot i won't lie but the journey to finally getting the code to run perfectly was a really good one. Really enjoyed it! 


### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library



### What I learned
 I learnt alot from this project. I just started learning react and it wasn't easy getting used to new commands. I learnt about props, hooks, events and how to implement them in my code.


### Continued development
 I found the use of hooks very useful in this project and i plan to learn alot more about them and work towards building more projects with them and getting better.
